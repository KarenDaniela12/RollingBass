            <p>I seen a perfect opportunity and thought we should take it. So I pulled of the side of the dirt road and parked the van. All three of us got out and headed for the fence. Devin wasting no time was the first to jump it, she basically flew over it like you see in some parkour video. AJ was next to jump and one foot after the other she was over. Being the rookie in this of course I was left for last but with some motivation from my friends and the rush of not getting caught I jummped the fence.</p>
            <p>"Wooooh, were in!", I said</p>
            <p>Just like that were able to enjoy the festival and watch our favorite artists preform at the greatest show ever. Im so glad I decided to go on this trip, AJ, and Devin both had a blast and It was the single most unforgetable experience I will ever have with them.</p>
