            <h1>Around back</h1>
    
            <p>I followed a dirt road that led us to the back of the festival where all the preformers entered through. There were security guards everywhere, It looked impossible for us to find some way to sneak in. As we approached the end of the dirt road Devin pointed out an employee entrance sign that led down some unkown path. I was skeptical about going through there and noticed an unoccupied area where all we had to do was hop a fence and we would be in</p>
            <p>"It's your call" Devin said.</p>
