            <h1>Nervous</h1>
    
            <p>I was really nervous about sneaking in I have never broke the rules before in my like so I was just thinking of the different possible ways things could go wrong.</p>
            <p>As we got closer you could feel the ground shaking from the bass in the speakers. The neon lights were overtaking the beautiful landscape. There were lights on fake trees, trailers, flowers, rollercoasters and more. It was like a city of lights. As we approached we saw people standing out side trying to sell tickes. AJ thought we should just buy the tickets and not even run the risk of trying to sneak in. Devin on the other hand being the mastermind behind the whole plan thought we should just Keep driving around back and stick to the plan.</p>
