            <h1>The end</h1>
    
            <p>Since I trusted Devin and her expertise I followed through to the employee entrance. We drove slowly by an unattended gate, all three us looked at each other being skeptical that It couldnt have been that easy. Sure enough I parked next to a row of cars who I assumed to be the real employees, turned off the engine and we all got out.</p>
            <p>We walked towards the front and came across a backstage entrance door. Just as we were about to open it we heard shout from the distance "Hey". We all turned to see a guy in a yellow secuity shirt standing as tall as a mountain. He say's "Did you gus get your backstage pases". Devin first the speak in confindence replied "No actually we were told to pick them up here, this is our first time coming to a festival like this". The security guard without a word slowly reach for his back pocket and took out three glowing badges and said "here you go I just so happen to have some extra ones".</p>
            <p>Just like that were able to enjoy the festival and watch our favorite artists preform at the greatest show ever. We even got to meet some of them since Devin the mastermind got us backstage passes. Im so glad I decided to go on this trip, AJ, and Devin both had a blast and It was the single most unforgetable experience I will ever have with them.</p>
